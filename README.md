Why is navbar commented out? If you don't plan to use that, take it out.
Meta tags for description, keywords, author
You have a link called javascript.js at the bottom of the tumbler page. You don't have a file called that.
There is nothing in your main.js file. If you don't plan to use it, delete it.
Couldn't get the video to play on the home page. May just be the network, but check it on your live link
Help and Contact links in the footer go nowhere. Need to create a way to contact and get help or take them out.
Why does each item have "select size" twice?
Not sure if you need the search bar unless you plan to get it working
Anton's last name is Maxwell
If you don't plan to finish the checkout, take it out.
