We created our website with simplicity on our minds so the consumer can easily find what they want to find on each page.
Our color scheme consisted of a Cardinal Red color and Grey to contrast against the mostly soft-white background of the website.
We chose the font Sriracha because it's easy to read but also fits the style of the website.
We tried to make our navigation as easy as possible with links clearly stating what the page it leads to is for.

Anmar:
I created the base template of the website which is the white container with the collage picture on the left and right side of the body of the website. I also put most of my time into the shop page where I had trouble coming up with a design, but I finally found out about Modals. I created a View Item button which opened the product's modal where you can view the item's price and place an order. I didn't have enough time to look into how to use javascript to make a fully functional checkout page so I just added a form to the modals where you can enter your information to place and order. In addition to this I made most of the site accessible to mobile devices and responsive. I helped my teammates out with other things here and there across the website which helped me learn a lot more about html and css by helping them. Before this semester, coding has always interested me but I never could get myself into it and this class has helped me dig deeper and realize that I actually enjoy web design.

I contributed by the shop now button in the home page. I created the video page concept and made it responsive. I created the History page. I introduced all three of the creators and linked their Instagram and there YouTube Chanel. Helped with little things all around the website like font size. I also contributed to making the history page responsive.
